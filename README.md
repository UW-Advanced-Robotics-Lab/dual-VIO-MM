# Dual-VIO-MM 
This work is a tailored dual-VIO for a mobile manipulator with arm kinematics.
The Dual-VIO-MM is an optimization based tightly coupled multi-VIO fusion with arm kinematics.
This work contains a baseline dual-VIO (a multi-threaded VINS-Mono), and a proposed dual-VIO-Arm (a multi-threaded VINS-Mono with Arm Odometry).
